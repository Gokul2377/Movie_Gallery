# Movie_Gallery

Disclaimer: This project is an extension of my Art Gallery project, hence it focuses more on the back-end with minimal styling.

An Online Movie Gallery is where Creators get to publish their work to the world, while Customers can view and purchase their clips using their E-wallet. Creators can upload any video format of their choice, along with its details and have it stored in their personal account. They can view the details of how well their work is doing from the Creator lobby. Customers can view the entire catalog of artworks from Artists around the world. Like it? Purchase it from your E-wallet. Customers feeling generous? Why not support these hardworking Artists by donating from your E-Wallet.

In the end, this is a medium of sharing your creations and having people support your work!
